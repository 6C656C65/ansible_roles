# You need to have the following project https://github.com/6C656C65/custom_iso
# You can put it in submodule or simply clone it, the path of this project "custom_iso" must be indicated in the following variable
# By default, the variable contains the path of the custom_iso project as a module at the root of your playbook
# Here is the command used: git submodule add https://github.com/6C656C65/custom_iso custom_iso
custom_iso_path: "{{ playbook_dir }}/custom_iso"

  # You must have a preseed.cfg file to customize the debian iso
  # Relative paths are based on the custom_iso project
  # Here is an example of a debian preseed file : https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/example-preseed.txt
  # By default, the preseed file is located at the root of the project, so next to the custom_iso folder
